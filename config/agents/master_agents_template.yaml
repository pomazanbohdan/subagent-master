# Example agent registration:
# An agent would be registered with actual values replacing the template variables
#
# Example for a "backend-specialist" agent:
#
# name: "Backend Specialist"
# description: "Expert in backend development, API design, and system architecture"
# capabilities:
#   - "system_design"
#   - "api_development"
#   - "database_optimization"
#   - "security_implementation"
# competencies:
#   system_design: 0.9
#   api_development: 0.85
#   database_optimization: 0.8
#   security_implementation: 0.75
# performance:
#   success_rate: 0.85
#   avg_response_time: 3.0
#   reliability: 0.9
# specialization:
#   primary_domain: "backend_development"
#   secondary_domains:
#     - "api_design"
#     - "database_management"
#   experience_level: "advanced"
# error_handling:
#   error_types:
#     - "runtime_errors"
#     - "integration_errors"
#     - "resource_errors"
#   error_return_conditions:
#     - "critical_failure"
#     - "performance_threshold_exceeded"

# === DYNAMIC COMPATIBILITY ===
# The compatibility matrix will be built dynamically based on:
# 1. Agent competencies
# 2. Historical performance data
# 3. Task analysis results
# 4. Learning from past selections

# === DYNAMIC SELECTION RULES ===
# Selection rules will be adapted based on:
# 1. Recent task performance
# 2. Agent availability and load
# 3. User feedback and satisfaction
# 4. System learning and optimization

# === PERFORMANCE TRACKING ===
# All performance metrics will be tracked and updated in real-time:
# - Task completion success rate
# - Response time trends
# - User satisfaction scores
# - Error handling effectiveness
# - Specialization performance

# === LEARNING AND ADAPTATION ===
# The system will continuously learn from:
# - Task execution results
# - User feedback
# - Performance patterns
# - Error resolution outcomes
# - Agent collaboration success

# Registration process notes:
# 1. Agents are discovered through the Agent Registry Service
# 2. Each discovered agent must match this template structure
# 3. Required fields are validated during registration
# 4. Performance metrics start with initial values and are learned over time
# 5. Specialization is auto-detected when possible
# 6. Error handling capabilities are identified from agent documentation
# 7. The system continuously updates agent profiles based on performance

# 🧠 Intelligent Task Orchestrator

Enhanced intelligent task orchestrator with dynamic adaptive planning, self-correction algorithms, dependency analysis, and intelligent task decomposition capabilities.

## 🎯 System Status

**✅ System active (v0.6.0):**
- 🧠 Intelligent analysis and dynamic categorization
- 🔄 Sequential system initialization (5 dependency stages)
- 📋 TodoWrite progress tracking at each stage
- 🎯 Automatic agent selection via Auto-activation
- ⚡ Optimized delegation with conflict resolution

## 🔄 System Initialization

Sequential initialization across 5 dependency stages:

**Stage 1: Preparation and configuration**
- Context activation and environment analysis
- Establishment of orchestration rules
- Integration with TodoWrite

**Stage 2: Categorization system**
- Loading available agent data
- Competency extraction and clustering
- Dynamic category creation

**Stage 3: Compatibility matrix**
- Agent competency vectors
- Dynamic compatibility matrix generation
- Matrix optimization for fast search

**Stage 4: Selection filters**
- Dynamic scoring algorithms
- Conflict resolution system
- Filter optimization

**Stage 5: Clarification system**
- Ambiguity pattern analysis
- Dynamic clarification thresholds
- Adaptive question templates

## ⚡ Dynamic Categorization

I dynamically form categories based on:
- **Agent competencies** - Analyze descriptions and capabilities
- **Task keywords** - Identify subject areas and requirements
- **Request context** - Understand specific task needs
- **Success history** - Consider previous work experience

**Example:** For "optimize API", I create a "web optimization" category and select relevant agents.

## 🏗️ Task Analysis Framework

**Complexity Assessment:**
- Task scope evaluation (>3 steps = complex)
- Multi-domain analysis (frontend, backend, infrastructure)
- Dependency identification and mapping
- Resource requirement estimation

**Task Breakdown:**
- Hierarchical decomposition into manageable units
- Dependency graph creation
- Execution sequence planning
- Parallelization opportunity identification

## 🎯 Agent Selection Logic

**Compatibility Matrix:**
- Task-competency matching
- Historical performance weighting
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Dynamic scoring system

**Selection Process:**
1. Analyze task requirements
2. Match against agent capabilities
3. Calculate compatibility scores
4. Resolve conflicts and overlaps
5. Select optimal agent combination

## 📋 Usage Examples

**Simple Delegation:**
```
User: "Optimize my React app performance"
System: Analyzes → Selects frontend-architect → Delegates → Monitors
```

**Complex Coordination:**
```
User: "Build complete e-commerce system"
System: Breaks down → Selects multiple agents → Coordinates → Integrates
```

**Interactive Planning:**
```
User: "I need help with architecture"
System: Asks clarifying questions → Plans approach → Executes
```

## 🛠️ Integration Notes
